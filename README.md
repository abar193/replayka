# Replayka

Problem: a (low-traffic) static blog hosted with GitHub Pages.
How many users actually read what I'm writing? What are their thoughts?

Solution: Replayka. An open-source service that can be hosted at a low price and
will analyze for you just that.

Made with Quarkus, QueryDSL and Java 17 in my free time.

# Deployment

I used fly.io to get my free hosting for the application. 

## DB

As for the database, I had to enter my credit card (hope I won't regret it) to 
get a whole 3GB of storage. Plan is to see how long it will last and then start
optimizations, unless I'll want to, well, pay (eugh!)

```flyctl pg create
? Choose an app name (leave blank to generate one): replayka-db
automatically selected personal organization: %me%
Some regions require a paid plan (fra, maa).
See https://fly.io/plans to set up a plan.

? Select region: Amsterdam, Netherlands (ams)
? Select configuration: Specify custom configuration
? Initial cluster size - Specify at least 3 for HA 1
? Select VM size: shared-cpu-1x - 256
? Volume size 3
```

Store credentials and whatever output you got, you will need it later.

Proxy connection to DB: `fly proxy 5432 -a replayka-db`.

Connect to postgres (on `localhost:5432`) using credentials that were provided to you in `pg create`, and do:
```
    CREATE USER quarkus WITH PASSWORD 'Something Secure Here, Please';
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO quarkus;
    CREATE SCHEMA replayka AUTHORIZATION quarkus;
```

## App

Deploying application can be done using `fly.toml` and `flyctl deploy` (or `launch` for the first run?) 

Create your own GitHub App for authentication. 

Set secrets for `GITHUB_ID`, `GITHUB_SECRET` and `DB_PASS` (the one you created for your quarkus user).

# Generated boilerplate text from Quarkus below

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/survey-quarkus-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
